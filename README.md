# QGAN

SOTA Quantum Generative Adversial Networks have trouble generating high quality images and usually tend to use lower resolution images. A lot of the recent QGANs use a smaller version (usually 8*8 or 16*16) version of the MNIST dataset. 
We need the ability for GANs to be able to produce higher quality images as well. 

In this project we try to adapt the PatchGAN [1] model to a larger dataset.
